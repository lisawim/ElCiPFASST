[pyElCiPFASST](https://github.com/lisawim/pyElCiPFASST) is a project by applying PFASST to electrical circuits. Further, this project is a contribution to the priority program of the DFG [SPP 1984](https://www.spp1984.de/). It is devoted to the research of hybrid and multimodal energy systems. Our project deals with the space-time parallel simulation of multimodal energy systems.

This website provides a detailed tutorial, in which energy systems are explained and applied using the parallel full approximation scheme in space and time (PFASST).
