[ElCiPFASST](https://github.com/lisawim/pyElCiPFASST) is a self-named project by applying PFASST to electrical circuits. Further, this project is a contribution to the priority program of the DFG [SPP 1984](https://www.spp1984.de/). It is devoted to the research of hybrid and multimodal energy systems. Our project deals with the space-time parallel simulation of multimodal energy systems.

This website provides a detailed tutorial, in which energy systems are explained and applied using spectral deferred corrections (SDC) and the parallel full approximation scheme in space and time (PFASST). Applications in the tutorial focuses on Python coding for which the well-known Python implementation [pySDC](https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/pySDC) is used. Better understanding the key features of SDC and PFASST, the [website to pySDC](https://parallel-in-time.org/pySDC/) containing a tutorial is highly recommended.
